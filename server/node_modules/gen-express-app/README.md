## Quick Start

```bash
npx gen-express-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Why gen-express-app ?

`gen-expressp-app` is an Express application generating tool inspired by [express-generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator), retaining most of its excellent features and extending and improving where it falls short. We fully support `ESM module` and provide `TypeScript` templates to choose from, as well as an easy-to-use `interactive interface`. These are all cool features that express-generator does not have!

## Usage

### Interactive Interface

Interactive interface is super easy to use:

```bash
npx gen-express-app
# or specify project-name
npx gen-express-app express-app
```

follow the steps on CLI then you can head into your express application.

### Command Line Options

You can also use the command line options, just like the way you did before.

- example:

```bash
npx gen-express-app express-app --view=ejs --package=pnpm
```

- get help by typing `--help`:

```bash
npx gen-express-app --help

Usage: gen-express-app [project-name]

Arguments:
  project-name                    name for your express app

Options:
  -V, --version                   output the current version
  -t, --template <template-name>  choose express template (choices: "javascript", "typescript", "javascript-mvc", "typescript-mvc")
